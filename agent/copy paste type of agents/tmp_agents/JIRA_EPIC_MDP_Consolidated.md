## Critical Cross-Domain Dependencies

### Primary Data Flow
```
Market Data Providers → ITS (MDP System) → PSO (Financial Instruments) →
  ├─ RFC (Risk Models)
  ├─ CPB (Customer Channels)
  └─ BMS (Market Analysis)
```

### Key Integration Points
1. **ITS ↔ PSO**: Data feed quality, format compatibility, historical data migration
2. **PSO ↔ RFC**: Valuation data for risk calculations, regulatory reporting
3. **ITS ↔ CPB**: API availability, eBranch integration, customer-facing data access
4. **PSO ↔ BMS**: Reference data, competitive pricing, market intelligence
5. **ES ↔ All Domains**: Legal contract validation, regulatory compliance oversight

## Critical Assumptions Requiring Validation

| ID | Assumption | Domains | Risk | Validation Owner | Timeline |
|----|------------|---------|------|------------------|----------|
| ASM-001 | Continuous market data access during migration (dual-feed capability) | ITS, PSO, RFC, CPB | CRITICAL | ITS + PSO | Week 1 |
| ASM-002 | Data quality maintained or improved post-migration | PSO, RFC, BMS, ITS | CRITICAL | ITS + RFC | Week 1-2 |
| ASM-003 | Historical data migration completeness (7-10 years) | PSO, RFC, BMS, ES | CRITICAL | ITS + PSO | Week 2-4 |
| ASM-004 | Zero-downtime requirement achievable | ITS, PSO, RFC, CPB | CRITICAL | ITS | Week 1-2 |
| ASM-005 | Provider contracts allow platform changes | PSO, ES, ITS | CRITICAL | ES + PSO | Week 1 |
| ASM-006 | Backward compatibility for downstream systems | ITS, CPB, BMS | HIGH | ITS | Week 2-4 |

## Significant Constraints

### Regulatory & Compliance
- **Quarterly regulatory reporting deadlines** (RFC): Avoid cutover within 6 weeks of Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec
- **MiFID II audit trail requirements** (ES, RFC): No gaps in surveillance or reporting
- **7-year data retention compliance** (ITS, RFC, ES): Full historical data migration mandatory

### Operational
- **99.99% availability SLA** (ITS, CPB): Zero-downtime requirement
- **<100ms real-time latency** (ITS, RFC): Performance engineering critical
- **99.5% eBranch SLA** (CPB): Customer-facing systems continuity
- **24/5 global trading hours** (CPB, RFC): Phased rollout across time zones

### Resource & Timing
- **RFC SMEs unavailable Nov-Feb** (RFC): Year-end activities, regulatory reporting
- **Q4 campaign calendar** (BMS): Limited UAT availability Oct-Dec
- **Legal review 4-6 weeks** (ES): Non-compressible, on critical path
- **CAB approval 2 weeks** (ITS): Change management procedures

---

## High-Risk Areas

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance degradation** post-migration (ITS, RFC, CPB) - latency requirements not met
2. **Data consistency failures** during migration (ITS, PSO, RFC) - reconciliation errors
3. **Provider integration issues** (ITS, PSO) - connectivity, format compatibility
4. **Legacy system dependencies** (ITS, CPB, BMS) - backward compatibility breaks

### Business Risks
1. **Trading operations disruption** (PSO, RFC, CPB) - revenue impact, client losses
2. **Regulatory non-compliance** (RFC, ES) - penalties, license risk
3. **Customer experience degradation** (CPB, BMS) - service level breaches, complaints
4. **Provider contract violations** (ES, PSO) - legal exposure, termination risk

### Operational Risks
1. **Insufficient support readiness** (ES, ITS) - incident resolution delays
2. **Data quality degradation** (PSO, RFC, BMS) - decision-making impact
3. **Historical data loss** (PSO, RFC, ES) - regulatory/audit failures
4. **Project timeline pressure** (All) - quality compromises, rushed deployment

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Validation & Planning (Week 1-8)

**IMMEDIATE (Week 1-2):**
- Legal contract review - all data provider agreements (ES lead)
- CNB regulatory consultation - confirm no new licensing required (ES + RFC)
- Infrastructure capacity assessment (ITS)
- Legacy data quality audit (ITS + PSO)
- Provider API compatibility validation (ITS + PSO)
- Stakeholder alignment workshop - all domains

**SHORT-TERM (Week 3-8):**
- Technical architecture design - event-driven, microservices (ITS)
- Data format mapping workshop (ITS + PSO + RFC)
