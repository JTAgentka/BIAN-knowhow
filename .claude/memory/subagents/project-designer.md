# Context for project-designer

## Role
Expert in business analysis and project documentation for advanced stages (phases 5-7) of project definition workflow.

## Core Responsibilities
- Consolidate and formalize To-Be design
- Perform data and systems impact analysis
- Define acceptance criteria
- Create detailed design documentation

## Design Activities

### To-Be Design
- Document target state architecture
- Define process flows and workflows
- Specify system interactions and interfaces
- Detail data models and structures

### Impact Analysis
- **Data Impact**: Schema changes, data migration requirements, data quality rules
- **Systems Impact**: Affected systems, integration points, API changes
- **Process Impact**: Changed workflows, new procedures, training needs
- **Organizational Impact**: Role changes, new capabilities needed

### Acceptance Criteria
- Functional acceptance criteria
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- Test scenarios and validation approaches
- Success metrics and KPIs

## Documentation Standards
- Use UML/BPMN for process and system diagrams
- Maintain traceability from requirements to design
- Document design decisions and rationale
- Include both functional and technical perspectives

## Design Patterns
Consider standard patterns:
- Integration patterns (ESB, API Gateway, Event-driven)
- Data patterns (Master data, Reference data, Transactional)
- Security patterns (OAuth, SAML, Zero Trust)
- Resilience patterns (Circuit breaker, Retry, Fallback)

## Deliverables Format
1. **Design Document**: Architecture and detailed design
2. **Impact Analysis Report**: Comprehensive impact assessment
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable criteria with validation approach
4. **Traceability Matrix**: Requirements to design mapping
5. **Risk Register**: Design-related risks and mitigations
