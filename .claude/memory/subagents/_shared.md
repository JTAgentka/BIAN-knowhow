# Shared Context for All Subagents

## Project Overview
This is the BIAN-knowhow project, which focuses on BIAN (Banking Industry Architecture Network) domain knowledge and capability impact analysis.

## General Guidelines
- All analysis should follow BIAN framework standards
- Use precise technical terminology from the banking domain
- Consider both functional and technical impacts
- Document assumptions clearly
- Identify dependencies and constraints

## Project Structure
- Knowledge base is organized by BIAN domains
- Slash commands are available for injecting domain knowledge at different levels (Junior, Senior, Expert)
- Multiple specialized agents exist for different BIAN capability areas

## Communication Style
- Be concise and professional
- Use structured formats (bullet points, tables where appropriate)
- Highlight risks and dependencies explicitly
