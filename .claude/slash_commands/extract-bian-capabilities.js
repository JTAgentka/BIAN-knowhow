## BIAN Capability Extraction Plan

### Step 1: Find all MHTML files
- Search directory: ${directoryPath}
- Look for files with .mhtml extension
- Include subdirectories

### Step 2: Process files in parallel
- Use BIAN capability extractor sub-agent: @.claude/subagents/bian-capability-extractor.md
- Extract structured data from each file:
  - Role Definition
  - Example of Use
  - Executive Summary
  - Key Features
  - API BIAN Portal Link
  - Served By / Serves relationships
  - Triggered By / Triggers relationships
  - List of Scenarios with links

### Step 3: Save results
- Create Markdown files with structured tables
- Create JSON files with structured objects
- Save in same directory structure as source files
- Use descriptive filenames based on capability names

### Execution Command for Claude Code:
Use TodoWrite to track progress, then:
1. Glob pattern: ${directoryPath}/**/*.mhtml
2. Task tool with bian-capability-extractor for each file
3. Write tool to save .md and .json files
