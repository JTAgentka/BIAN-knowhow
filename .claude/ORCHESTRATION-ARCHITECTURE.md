# BIAN Project Analysis - New Orchestration Architecture

## Architecture Change Summary

The project management system has been redesigned to eliminate sub-agent nesting complexity and enable better parallel execution capabilities.

## Old Architecture (Problematic)
```
User → Task(project-manager) → 5x Task(project-analyst) [nested sub-agents]
                              ↓
                              Task(project-designer) [nested]
                              ↓  
                              Task(project-documenter) [nested]
```

**Issues:**
- Sub-agent nesting creates complexity
- Parallel execution limitations in nested structure
- Context handoff complications
- Debugging difficulties

## New Architecture (Improved)
```
User → /orchestrate-project-analysis → Main Context → 5x Task(project-analyst) [parallel]
                                                    ↓
                                                    Task(project-designer) [sequential]
                                                    ↓
                                                    Task(project-documenter) [sequential]
```

**Benefits:**
- Native parallel execution in main context
- Direct visibility into all sub-agent executions
- Simplified context management
- Better error handling and debugging
- User control through command interface

## Implementation Files

### Commands
- `.claude/commands/orchestrate-project-analysis.md` - Main orchestration logic and workflow
- `.claude/slash_commands/orchestrate-project-analysis.md` - Slash command documentation
- `.claude/slash_commands/orchestrate-project-analysis.js` - JavaScript implementation

### Active Agents (Simplified)
- `.claude/agents/project-analyst.md` - Domain analysis with persona injection
- `.claude/agents/project-designer.md` - Design consolidation (phases 5-7)
- `.claude/agents/project-documenter.md` - Documentation finalization (phases 8-11)

### Archived
- `.claude/archive/subagents/project-manager.md` - Moved from agents, no longer a sub-agent

## Usage

Instead of calling `project-manager` as a sub-agent:

**Old Way:**
```
Task(project-manager, "Execute BRQ202 analysis", prompt)
```

**New Way:**
```
/orchestrate-project-analysis "BRQ202 requirement text" [expertise-level]
```

## Workflow Execution

When `/orchestrate-project-analysis` is invoked:

1. **Main context reads** orchestration command logic
2. **Initializes** manager and session context files  
3. **Launches 5 parallel** project-analyst instances with knowledge injection
4. **Waits for completion**, then launches project-designer sequentially
5. **Waits for design**, then launches project-documenter sequentially
6. **Consolidates results** and reports comprehensive deliverables

## Context Management

The main context directly manages:
- Manager context tracking
- Session context recording  
- Agent handover coordination
- Quality gate validation
- Deliverable consolidation

## Expertise Level Control

Default: Senior Level across all domains
Override options:
- `Junior` - For basic analysis and learning-oriented approach
- `Expert` - For strategic and complex transformation initiatives
- Mixed levels can be specified in the requirement text

## Quality Gates

All quality validation happens in main context:
- ✅ Domain analysis completion validation
- ✅ Context transfer verification
- ✅ Artifact completeness checking
- ✅ Stakeholder coverage confirmation
- ✅ Final deliverable validation

This architecture provides much cleaner execution flow while maintaining all the sophisticated multi-domain analysis capabilities.
