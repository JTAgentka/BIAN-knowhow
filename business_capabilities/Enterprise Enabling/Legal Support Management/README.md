## Important Notes

⚠️ **Partial Extraction**: The current extraction represents only partial data from a single service operation within the Legal Support Management domain. A complete Service Domain specification would typically include:

- Multiple service operations beyond ExchangeLegalCompliance
- Additional control records and behavioral patterns
- Complete functional requirements specifications  
- Full data model definitions
- Additional asset types and business objects
- Comprehensive API specifications

To obtain the complete Legal Support Management capability specification, access to the main Service Domain MHTML file would be required.

## Usage Notes

The JSON file contains the complete BIAN architectural structure extracted from the available source, while the Markdown file provides business-friendly documentation. Due to the partial nature of the extraction, this should be considered a foundation that may need expansion with additional service operations and capabilities.
