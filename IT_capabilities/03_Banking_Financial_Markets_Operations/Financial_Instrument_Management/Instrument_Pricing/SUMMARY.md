# Instrument Pricing - Summary

## Overview
The Instrument Pricing capability manages financial instrument pricing data across multiple timeframes and price types. It publishes market prices (bid/ask), value prices (internal valuations), performance metrics, and accrued interest calculations through event streams and provides comprehensive reconciliation via REST APIs. The system supports both instant/real-time and daily pricing data.
